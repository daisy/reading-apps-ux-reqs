            The DAISY Reading Apps User Requirements establishes comprehensive
            user requirements for accessible digital reading applications,
            developed through collaboration between the DAISY Consortium,
            accessibility experts, and people with print disabilities. It
            provides essential guidance for developers, designers, and
            decision-makers creating or procuring reading systems that serve
            users with visual impairments, dyslexia, and other print
            disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specification goes beyond basic accessibility compliance to
            outline features that significantly improve usability and user
            satisfaction. These requirements cover text, audio, and hybrid
            reading experiences across key areas including navigation, screen
            reader support, read aloud, embedded audio, visual adjustments,
            bookmarking, highlighting, note-taking, answer entry, and library
            management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirements are categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization
            methodology (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have) to help developers
            allocate resources effectively. The document is grounded in user
            stories that illustrate real-world usage scenarios, ensuring
            requirements address both technical specifications and human needs.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This document presents a detailed set of user requirements to help
            developers, designers, and decision-makers understand what
            individuals with diverse print disabilities need and expect from
            digital reading solutions- especially when it comes to
            accessibility, usability, and inclusive design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Created through close collaboration between DAISY Consortium
            members, people with print disabilities, accessibility experts, and
            developers of specialized reading apps, this resource captures a
            wide range of expert knowledge and practical insights. This document
            represents the results of ten months of working group meetings,
            workshops, and discussions with developers. The requirements have
            been shaped and articulated by professionals with deep expertise in
            accessible reading technology, drawing on the lived experiences of
            people with print disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the document is particularly relevant for those developing or
            procuring specialized reading apps, it also offers valuable guidance
            for those working on mainstream reading platforms who wish to make
            their products outstandingly accessible and user-friendly for
            everyone. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that affordances made
            for users with print disabilities are often beneficial or convenient
            for other users. Whether you are building a new reading application
            from the ground up or enhancing an existing one, we invite you to
            explore these requirements not just as a treasure trove of insights
            into the needs of people with print disabilities, but as a roadmap
            toward more inclusive digital reading experiences.

            MoSCoW Prioritization Terminology
        </h2>
        <p>
            This user requirements specification uses the MoSCoW technique to
            categorize requirements by priority. Within each requirement area,
            requirements are presented in priority order according to the
            following classifications:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Must-have</em> - Critical requirements that are essential for
            creating an accessible reading application. These features are
            fundamental to ensuring users with print disabilities can
            effectively access and consume digital content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Should-have</em> - Important requirements that significantly
            enhance accessibility and usability for people with print
            disabilities. While not absolutely critical to basic reading
            functionality, omitting these features would notably reduce the
            application’s effectiveness in serving users’ needs and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Could-have</em> - Beneficial features that would further improve
            the reading experience for users with print disabilities. These
            requirements enhance accessibility and user satisfaction but are not
            essential for creating a functional, accessible reading application.

    <section id="navigation">
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            Effective navigation is a critical aspect of digital accessibility.
            Users often face challenges in understanding where they are within a
            digital publication or application and how to move seamlessly
            between sections. For example, screen reader users, who access
            content sequentially through synthetic speech or braille displays,
            rely on navigation features to rapidly and efficiently orient
            themselves and access content efficiently. Readers with learning
            differences benefit from clear navigation structures, well-defined
            headings, and consistent cues. Understanding and addressing these
            user requirements is key to creating inclusive digital experiences
            that empower all users to navigate content independently and with
            ease.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The user must have a straightforward way to navigate forward and
            backward through the content
        </h3>
        <p>
            For content with text it must be possible to move forward and
            backward from the currently displayed screen. For content with audio
            it must be possible to move forward and backward using time-based
            navigation.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to navigate the publication using the Table of
            Contents
        </h3>
        <p>
            When displaying the table of contents, the focus must be on the
            entry that matches the user's current reading position. If the
            publication’s table of content comprises a hierarchy of entries
            (e.g. volumes, chapters, subsections) then it must be presented as a
            tree view, nested list view or any other view that conveys the
            structure to the user. The user must have a mechanism to move
            between items in the table of contents of the same level
            (e.g. between the chapters without having to go via the
            subsections).
        </p>
        <p>
            Page numbers or percentage information could be provided in the
            table of contents.
        </p>
        <p>The user could be able to search within the table of contents.</p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must have a way to navigate the content by pages
        </h3>
        <p>
            When the publication includes page markup, then it must be possible
            to navigate by page numbers. If the publication does not include
            page markup it could be possible to navigate by ‘pseudo pages’
            (where the app uses an algorithm to approximate navigation points
            equivalent to typical page lengths).
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must have a way to go to a specific location in audio-based
            content
        </h3>
        <p>
            When reading audio-based content it must be possible to go to a
            specific location. This could be based on time, percentage, or
            another approach.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to return to the last location the next time
            they open the publication
        </h3>
        <p>
            The saving of the user's location must happen automatically, for
            example when closing the app. When reading text-based content it
            must be possible to return to the approximate location (such as the
            same page or screen of text). It could be possible to return to the
            exact last location.
        </p>
        <p>
            When reading audio-based content it must be possible to return to
            the exact last location.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to determine their location in the content
        </h3>
        <p>
            The user must be able to get information about their current
            position in the publication without losing their reading position.
            The minimum information expected is the percentage progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user should be able to determine the current chapter, section,
            and current page number where this information is provided in the
            publication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Screen reader users must be able to get information about their
            current position in the content without losing their reading
            position.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to go back to a previous location in the
            content
        </h3>
        <p>
            A “go back” feature within the reading application must allow users
            to explicitly return to a previous location after navigating through
            a digital publication, for example, after following an internal
            link, reading a footnote or reference, jumping to a search result,
            or accessing a glossary entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some screen readers offer limited navigation history, an
            in-app “go back” function provides a more predictable and
            user-controlled experience, and benefits users who do not use screen
            readers as well.
        </p>
        <p>The application should support multiple location histories.</p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>

        <h2>Screen Reader Support</h2>
        <p>
            Effective screen reader support depends not only on well-structured
            content but also on the reading app’s ability to interact seamlessly
            with assistive technologies. The application or platform must enable
            screen readers to accurately interpret and present semantic markup,
            navigation elements, and interactive features to users using
            synthetic speech and/or a braille display. This close collaboration
            between the reading app and screen reader ensures that users can
            navigate, access, and understand content efficiently. Addressing
            these technical requirements is essential to provide a fully
            accessible and usable experience for screen reader users.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to use their screen reader in the user
            interface
        </h3>
        <p>
            The user must be able to navigate and interact with all elements of
            the app—including menus, dialogs, buttons, and content—using their
            assistive technology. All interactive components shall provide
            appropriate semantic labels and roles to support accessibility
            standards such as WCAG 2.1 and ARIA guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            Screen reader/assistive technology users must be able to navigate
            through content by headings, block items, lines, words and
            characters
        </h3>
        <p>
            This functionality is provided by the screen reader or assistive
            technology, but it relies on how the audio and text content is
            exposed within the app. To support navigation by headings, blocks,
            lines, words, and characters, the content must be properly
            structured and tagged so that the screen reader can interpret and
            present it accurately to the user.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            Screen reader users must be able to read continuously from the
            current position, and be able to pause, then resume reading from the
            paused reading location
        </h3>
        <p>
            For content with text it must be possible to use the continuous
            reading feature of a screen reader to start, pause and resume
            continuous reading. The reading should not stop at the end of the
            display but continue until the end is reached or stopped by the
            user.
        </p>
        <p>Priority: Must-have</p>
        <h3>
            The user must be able to take advantage of their screen reader’s
            ability to leverage semantic markup in the content
        </h3>
        <p>
            The application must allow users to read publication content using a
            screen reader. The rendered content must expose the accessibility
            semantics to the screen reader. Thus headings, lists, tables,
            images, and other semantic elements must be exposed to the screen
            reader so that it can be interpreted by the screen reader. Where
            present, the semantics of links—such as whether they are
            bibliographic references or footnotes—should be made available to
            screen readers.

            The user must be able to use a scrolling (rather than a paginated
            mode) to enable the use of screen reader features (such as
            navigating to next/previous heading, landmark, graphic, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the publication comprises multiple ‘documents’ the app may
            support loading the next or previous document via scroll actions or
            through dedicated navigation buttons. In this case the user must be
            able to easily move to the next document.

            In addition to the table of contents and other navigation provided
            by the content creator, the user could use additional navigation
            features offered by the reading app. Such navigation affordances are
            especially beneficial to print disabled readers. For example, the
            app could provide navigation by heading, between landmarks, tables,
            figures, and mathematics expressions.

                Note: In this document the term “read aloud” refers to the app
                leveraging text-to-speech (TTS) to provide an audio option for
                text-based content. This is distinct from embedded audio. The read
                aloud feature is essential to many users with print disabilities who
                don’t use screen readers, and offers additional reading flexibility
                to everyone.
            </p>

        <p>
            Read aloud functionality plays a crucial role in making digital
            content accessible to people with visual impairments, dyslexia, or
            other reading challenges. By leveraging TTS technology, reading apps
            provide a complementary or alternative way to access text-based
            information through audio, reducing barriers to reading and
            comprehension. To offer a smooth and flexible listening experience,
            the reading app must work seamlessly with the TTS engine to support
            logical reading order, language changes, and provide the user
            control over playback and navigation.

            The user must be able to use a text-to-speech read aloud feature for

        <h2>Embedded Audio</h2>
        <p>
            Note: In this document the term “embedded audio” refers to the audio
            content (could be human narrated audio or generated text-to-speech)
            that is provided as part of the publication. This is distinct from
            read aloud, where the app dynamically uses on device or cloud TTS to
            create an audio rendition whilst reading the publication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Embedded audio includes both audio-only publications and
            synchronized audio-text formats, where the audio is aligned with the
            visual text. Audio-only formats are a long-standing favorite among
            people with print disabilities, offering a streamlined, immersive
            listening experience. They are also increasingly popular in
            mainstream contexts, such as for multitasking or screen-free
            reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Synchronized audio-text formats offer additional benefits by
            enabling users to follow the structure of the text while listening.
            This supports a wide range of reading strategies—for example,
            allowing users to navigate the text with assistive technologies,
            adjust playback speed or verbosity, or combine listening with
            reading for improved comprehension and control. Although this
            functionality is not yet widely supported in reading systems, it
            holds great potential for inclusive and flexible reading
            experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section outlines the core user requirements for interacting
            with embedded audio, including playback control, synchronization
            with text, visual emphasis, and customization. These features ensure
            that users can access high-quality narration in a way that aligns
            with the structure and intent of the publication.
        </p>
        <p>
            While synchronized playback is well covered here, the ability to
            switch flexibly between listening and reading modes—such as pausing
            narration to read with a screen reader and resuming from the same
            point—is not yet addressed and remains an area for future
            development.

            Flexible display options in a reading app are essential for people
            with print disabilities, especially those with low vision or
            dyslexia. Allowing users to customize the visual presentation of
            text and images — including font type, size, color contrast,
            spacing, and margins — significantly improves readability and
            comfort. These adaptations reduce visual stress and cognitive load,
            making it easier for users to process and understand content. By
            removing visual barriers, reading apps become more accessible,
            empowering users to have a more personalized and effective reading
            experience.

            styles that optimize their reading experience. Typefaces with
            preferred letter shapes can aid in visual processing, improve

            Visual readability of text requires good visual contrast. Visual
            contrast is a product of the text characteristics, such as font
            weight (thickness, font stroke width) and font size, the
            lightness/darkness difference of the colors used for the text and
            the background, and other factors.

            Although increasing size is most common, some people with tunnel

        <p>
            The amount of line spacing (leading), word spacing (space between
            words) and letter spacing (space between letters/characters) impacts
            readability. People have different space requirements for reading

        </h3>
        <p>
            Justification impacts readability and tracking. Fully justified text
            creates uneven spaces between words and letters, leading to “rivers
            of white space” that disrupt reading flow and visual tracking,
            particularly for people with dyslexia. Users with low vision who
            rely on screen magnifiers may encounter exaggerated gaps or
            overlapping characters in justified text, making it harder to read.
            Center-aligned text is also problematic for multi-line blocks, as it
            disrupts smooth reading flow and makes it harder to find the
            beginning of lines. Depending on the reading order of the language
            concerned (left to right, or right to left) turning the
            justification or center-alignment off results in a left-aligned or
            right-aligned text.

            Having wide margins results in shorter line lengths. This may be
            useful for individuals with certain learning disabilities. Wide
            margins around paragraphs can make it easier for some individuals to

            Readable and optimal color combinations differs vastly among

            <p>
                Highlights visually mark portions of text to indicate importance
                or relevance. They are often used for quick reference and may be
                exported to create an essay plan, revision notes or similar.

                Notes are user-generated annotations that may contain text,
                audio, or other formats. They are typically used to capture
                thoughts, questions, or reflections on specific content. Notes
                can be attached to bookmarks and highlights.

            who rely on assistive technologies, well-integrated note
            functionality (such as easy navigation, and synchronization) ensures
            that these annotations are accessible and usable across different

            A more advanced option could allow users to share notes directly
            within the reading system, enabling collaboration or review among

            Learners with print disabilities can face significant challenges
            when completing exercises in books: if they are unable to read or
            write in physical books, they are often required to write their
            answers into a word processor, which can be time-consuming and
            mentally draining. The ability to input answers precisely where
            questions or prompts appear in the digital content makes the
            experience more intuitive and less fragmented.
        </p>
        <p>
            Questions can take many forms, and so the ability to enter various
            input types—from simple text fields to multiple-choice
            selections—ensures that all users can respond effectively and
            independently. Accessibility features such as screen reader
            compatibility and the ability to save and edit responses are
            essential for an inclusive and seamless user experience.
            Additionally, synchronization and export options provide greater
            flexibility, enabling users to access and manage their responses

            (e.g., sideloaded files). Some requirements apply specifically when
            the application integrates with one or more online catalogs, and
            their implementation may depend on the capabilities and interfaces
            those catalogs provide. Other requirements, such as managing the

        </p>
        <h3>
            Display word counts in tables of contents of serial publications
        </h3>
        <p>
            The app should display the word count for each article or chapter in
            the table of contents, helping users estimate the length and effort
            required for each section.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Disclose text style properties to assistive technologies, e.g. for
            presentation on braille devices
        </h3>
        <p>
            If supported by the platform, text style properties such as font,
            line spacing, indentation, justification, and emphasis (bold,
            italic, underline) should be made available to assistive
            technologies. This allows screen readers and braille displays to
            convey visual structure and emphasis in non-visual ways, enhancing
            comprehension.
        </p>
        <h3>Turn hyphenation on/off</h3>
        <p>
            Users should be able to enable or disable hyphenation. This
            customization supports a more accessible and comfortable reading
            experience, especially for users with dyslexia or low vision, by
            reducing visual clutter and improving text flow.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reflow of text for fixed layout as well
        </h3>
        <p>
            Text in fixed-layout documents should be able to reflow, allowing
            for better readability on small screens or when using magnification.
        </p>
        <h3>Regional navigation features</h3>
        <p>
            The app could provide region-based navigation which zooms in and
            steps the reader though a defined reading order. The reader could
            navigate between regions at their own pace.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Support for LLM inference or other processing
        </h3>
        <p>
            The app should allow integration of AI-powered features, such as
            summarization, question answering, or contextual assistance based on
            the content of the publication.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Print or export specific content
        </h3>
        <p>
            Users should be able to print or export selected parts of a
            publication, such as templates or activity pages. This supports
            hands-on learning and accessibility for users who benefit from
            physical or tactile formats.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Export content for alternative format production
        </h3>
        <p>
            The app must allow users to export content in a digital format
            suitable for creating alternative accessible formats, such as
            braille or large print.
        </p>
        <h3>Support for tactile graphics</h3>
        <p>
            The app should, where feasible, support the rendering of tactile
            graphics via compatible hardware such as refreshable Braille
            displays or pin-matrix devices. This functionality enables users
            with visual impairments to access graphical content embedded in
            general EPUB or similar document formats. As tactile display
            technology evolves, the implementation of this feature may need to
            be revisited. Initially, this support can be considered desirable
            but not mandatory, depending on user needs and technical
            feasibility.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Dynamic content based on user input
        </h3>
        <p>
            The user should be able to enter personal or contextual
            information—such as the number of servings in a recipe or a name for
            personalized narration—which then dynamically updates the content.
            This makes digital publications more engaging and practical, and
            helps reduce cognitive load for users with print disabilities.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Book recommendations based on personal preferences
        </h3>
        <p>
            The app should provide personalized book recommendations based on
            the user’s reading history, interests, or profile, making it easier
            to discover relevant content.
        </p>
        <h3>Book recommendation sharing</h3>
        <p>
            Users should be able to share book recommendations with others, for
            example via social media or within the reading platform, to
            encourage community and engagement.
        </p>
        <h3>Borrowing history indicator</h3>
        <p>
            The app should indicate which books a user has previously borrowed
            or read, helping them avoid duplicates and revisit favorites.
        </p>
        <h3>Digital clippings archive</h3>
        <p>
            The app should allow users to save and organize excerpts or quotes
            from digital publications, functioning as a digital scrapbook for
            easy reference and study.

            <h2>User Stories</h2>
            <p>
                To ground these requirements in real-world contexts, the working
                group developed a comprehensive set of user stories that
                describe specific scenarios and tasks people with print
                disabilities encounter when using digital reading applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                These user stories served as a foundation for the working
                group's discussions and helped prioritize requirements based on
                actual user experiences. We strongly encourage readers to review
                the <a
                href="https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/">complete
                collection of user stories</a>, as they provide valuable context
                for understanding why specific requirements were prioritized and
                offer practical insights into the lived experiences of users
                with print disabilities.

        <h2>EPUB Fundamental Accessibility Tests</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.epubtest.org">epubtest website</a> is a
            related DAISY Consortium initiative that serves as the home for
            accessibility testing of EPUB-based digital reading systems. The
            well-established fundamental accessibility tests available on
            epubtest.org informed the requirements in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evaluations on epubtest.org are completed with the same set of <a
            href="https://www.epubtest.org/test-books">
                standardized test books
            </a> to ensure consistency and accuracy across all reading systems.
            The test results help developers improve their products and enable
            consumers and institutional purchasers to make informed decisions
            when selecting accessible reading solutions. Testing is open to
            participation, and developers are encouraged to submit their reading
            systems for evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The epubtest.org initiative complements this user requirements
            document by providing practical, empirical data on how well reading
            systems implement fundamental accessibility features. While
            epubtest.org focuses on minimum baseline requirements for EPUB
            reading systems, this document takes a broader and more aspirational
            approach, covering text, audio, and hybrid reading experiences
            across multiple formats, and establishing comprehensive requirements
            that guide developers toward creating truly outstanding accessible
            reading solutions.
