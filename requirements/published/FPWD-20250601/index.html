<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive set of user requirements
developed as part of the <a
href="https://daisy.org/activities/projects/reading-apps-user-requirements/">DAISY
project to develop user requirements for reading apps</a>. Its purpose
is to help developers, designers, and decision-makers understand what
individuals with diverse print disabilities need and expect from digital
reading solutions- especially when it comes to accessibility, usability,
and inclusive design.</p>
<p>Created through close collaboration between <a
href="https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/">DAISY Consortium members
and friends</a>, (DAISY Consortium members, accessibility experts, and
developers of specialized reading apps), this resource captures a wide
range of expert knowledge and practical insights. The document draws on
the lived experiences of people with print disabilities and the
requirements have been shaped and articulated by professionals with deep
expertise in accessible reading technology.</p>
<p>This <strong>public working draft</strong> represents the results of
the work carried out in the first part of the project. It is not yet
comprehensive: several important topics still need to be addressed and
will be added in future iterations. Feedback and collaboration are
welcomed as the document evolves.</p>
<p>While the document is particularly relevant for those developing or
procuring specialized reading apps, it also offers valuable guidance for
those working on mainstream reading platforms who wish to make their
products outstandingly accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
Whether you’re building a new reading application from the ground up or
enhancing an existing one, we invite you to explore these requirements
not just as a checklist, but as a roadmap toward more inclusive digital
reading experiences.</p>

<h2 id="user-requirements">User Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Effective navigation is a critical aspect of digital accessibility,
particularly for users with diverse print disabilities. Users often face
challenges in understanding where they are within a digital publication
or application and how to move seamlessly between sections. Clear
navigation structures, well-defined headings, and consistent cues are
essential to help users orient themselves and access content
efficiently. Screen reader users, who experience content in a linear
format that is presented either as synthetic speech or via a braille
display, depend heavily on these elements to avoid confusion and
maintain a sense of control. Understanding and addressing these user
requirements is key to creating inclusive digital experiences that
empower all users to navigate content independently and with ease.</p>

the user is presented with the table of contents. If the publication’s
table of content comprises a hierachy of entries (eg volumes, chapters,
subsections) then it must be presented as a tree view, nested list view
or any other view that conveys the structure to the user. The user must
have a mechanism to move between items in the table of contents of the
same level (eg between the chapters without having to go via the
subsections).</p>

<h3 id="screen-reader-support">Screen Reader Support</h3>
<p>Effective screen reader support depends not only on well-structured
content but also on the reading app’s ability to interact seamlessly
with assistive technologies. The application or platform must enable
screen readers to accurately interpret and present semantic markup,
navigation elements, and interactive features to users. This close
collaboration between the reading app and screen reader ensures that
users can navigate, access, and understand content efficiently.
Addressing these technical requirements is essential to provide a fully
accessible and usable experience for screen reader users.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-use-their-screen-reader-in-the-user-interface.">The
user must be able to use their screen reader in the user interface.</h4>
<p>The user must be able to navigate and interact with all elements of
the app—including menus, dialogs, buttons, and content—using assistive
technologies. All interactive components shall provide appropriate
semantic labels and roles to support accessibility standards such as
WCAG 2.1 and ARIA guidelines.</p>

user must be able to take advantage of their screen reader’s ability to
leverage semantic markup in the content.</h4>
<p>The application must allow users to read publication content using a
screen reader. The rendered content must expose the accessibility
semantics to the screen reader. Thus headings, lists, tables, images and
other semantic elements must be exposed to the screen reader so that it
can be interpreted by the screen reader. Furthermore, semantics of links
need to be exposed, such as bibliographic or footnote, should be exposed
to the screen reader.</p>

user could use additional navigation features of the reading app.</h4>
<p>In addition to the table of contents and other navigation provided by
the content creator, the user could use additional navigation features
offered by the reading app that will be especially beneficial to print
disabled readers. For example, the app could provide navigation by
heading, between landmarks, tables, images and mathematics expressions,
irrespective of whether they are in the same content document.</p>

<h3 id="read-aloud">Read Aloud</h3>
<p>In this requirements document the term “read aloud” refers to the app
using Text To Speech (TTS) to provide an audio option for text-based
content.</p>
<p>Read aloud functionality plays a crucial role in making digital
content accessible to people with print disabilities, such as visual
impairments, dyslexia, or other reading challenges. By leveraging Text
To Speech (TTS) technology, reading apps provide an alternative way to
access text-based information through audio, reducing barriers to
reading and comprehension. To offer a smooth and flexible listening
experience, the reading app must work seamlessly with the TTS engine to
manage how text is processed, queued, and delivered. This includes
supporting logical reading order, language changes, and user control
over playback and navigation. Such close integration ensures that users
can access content audibly in a way that meets their individual needs,
enhancing independence, inclusivity, and overall usability.</p>

id="the-user-must-be-able-to-listen-to-text-based-content-using-synthetic-speech-text-to-speech.">The
user must be able to listen to text-based content using synthetic speech

<p>The user must be able to use a TTS read aloud feature for text-based
content. If the publication also has synchronised audio with the text
then the user must be able to choose the alternative of listening to the
TTS read aloud.</p>

The techniques for changing the text in display might include scrolling
the text to keep the text being read in the centre of the display, or
displaying a new screen of text and starting again at the top. Note that
users may be reading with large text, so additional care should be taken
to consider that the complete text of the first and last sentence may
not be in view. The user should be able to see the text being read. If
starting from the top of the display then the read aloud should start
from the first visble text in view (that is, should not read text that
is not visible). The display should promptly update to always show the
text being read, even if this is partway through a sentence at the
bottom of the display.</p>
<p>The user could have the ability to move to a different part of the
text whilst the read aloud continues. If viewing a different part of the

<h3 id="visual-adjustments">Visual Adjustments</h3>
<p>Flexible display options in a reading app are essential for people
with print disabilities, especially those with low vision or dyslexia.
Allowing users to customize the visual presentation of text and images —
including font type, size, color contrast, spacing, and margins —
significantly improves readability and comfort. These adaptations reduce
visual stress and cognitive load, making it easier for users to process
and understand content. By removing visual barriers, reading apps become
more accessible, empowering users to have a more personalized and
effective reading experience.</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-change-the-typeface.">The user must be
able to change the typeface.</h4>
<p>The user should be able to change the typeface of all text, choosing
from a range including sans serif and serif fonts. Individuals with low
vision or dyslexia often have specific preferences for font styles that
optimize their reading experience. Typefaces with preferred letter
shapes can aid in visual processing, improve comprehension and reduce
cognitive load.</p>

<p>Visual readability of text requires good visual contrast. Visual
contrast is a product of the text characteristics, such as font weight
(thickness, font stroke width) and font size, the lightness/darkness
difference of the colors used for the text and the background, and other
factors. For some people, bold text is easier to read which is why they
should be have bold font options. Many typefaces have a bold font and
some offer variable weight.</p>

<p>Justification impacts readability and tracking. Fully justified text
creates uneven spaces between words and letters, leading to “rivers of
white space” that disrupt reading flow and visual tracking, particularly
for people with dyslexia. Users with low vision who rely on screen
magnifiers may encounter exaggerated gaps or overlapping characters in
justified text, making it harder to read. Center-aligned text is also
problematic for multi-line blocks, as it disrupts smooth reading flow
and makes it harder to find the beginning of lines. Depending on the
reading order of the language concerned (left to right, or right to
left) turning the justification or center-alignment off results in a
left-aligned or right-aligned text.</p>

<p>Entering answers directly within digital publications is a feature
that enables active engagement and participation, especially for
learners with print disabilities. These users often face significant
challenges because if they cannot read or write directly in physical
books, and working with separate files for answers can be time-consuming
and mentally exhausting. They benefit greatly from being able to enter
their responses exactly where the question or prompt appears in the
digital content, making the process more intuitive and less fragmented.
Supporting a variety of input types—from simple text fields to selection
controls—ensures that all users can provide responses effectively and
independently. Accessibility considerations, such as screen reader
compatibility and the ability to save and edit answers, are essential to
create an inclusive and seamless user experience. Moreover,
synchronization and export capabilities enhance flexibility, allowing
users to access and manage their answers across devices and
contexts.</p>
<p>Digital book reading apps have not typically included this
