<p>The <a href="https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/requirements/published/CR-20251011">DAISY Reading Apps User Requirements</a>
establish comprehensive user requirements for accessible digital
reading applications, developed through collaboration between the DAISY
Consortium, accessibility experts, and people with print disabilities.
It provides essential guidance for developers, designers, and
decision-makers creating or procuring reading systems that serve users
with visual impairments, dyslexia, and other print disabilities.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal is to go beyond basic accessibility compliance and outline
features that significantly improve usability and user satisfaction.
These requirements apply to both specialized reading systems and
mainstream reading apps, covering text, audio, and hybrid reading
experiences.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Navigation:</strong> Effective navigation is critical for
digital accessibility, enabling users to move through content
efficiently using features like table of contents, page numbers, and
headings. Screen reader users particularly benefit from clear navigation
structures and continuous reading capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Screen Reader Support:</strong> Reading apps must enable
screen readers to interpret semantic markup, navigation elements, and
interactive features accurately. This includes proper exposure of
headings, lists, tables, and other structural elements to assistive
technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong> Text-to-speech functionality provides an
audio option for text-based content, helping users with visual
impairments, dyslexia, or reading challenges. The app must support
seamless playback with proper language handling, visual emphasis, and
playback controls.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded Audio:</strong> This covers pre-recorded audio
content (human-narrated or TTS) that comes with the publication, either
as audio-only or synchronized with text. Users must be able to control
playback, see synchronized text highlighting, and customize the
listening experience.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Adjustments:</strong> Flexible display options allow
users to customize text appearance including font type, size, spacing,
colors, and contrast to improve readability. These adaptations reduce
visual stress and cognitive load for users with low vision or
dyslexia.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking:</strong> Users must be able to create, manage,
and navigate between multiple bookmarks within publications to mark and
return to specific locations. Bookmarks should be automatically saved
and synchronized across devices when online.</p>
<p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> Users must be able to mark important
text portions with customizable colors or categories for quick reference
and review. Highlights should be distinguishable, hideable, and
automatically saved across sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Making Notes:</strong> Users must be able to create text or
audio annotations anchored to bookmarks or highlights, with the ability
to view notes in context while maintaining reading position. Notes
should be automatically saved and accessible to screen reader users.</p>
<p><strong>Entering Answers:</strong> Learners must be able to input
responses directly into embedded fields within publications, supporting
various input types from text to multiple choice. This functionality
helps users with print disabilities complete exercises without switching
to separate documents.</p>
<p><strong>Library and Bookshelf:</strong> Users must be able to search,
browse, acquire, and manage titles from multiple sources through
accessible authentication and intuitive organization. The app should
support both online catalog integration and sideloaded content with
synchronized updates.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Users must have access to clear
documentation, user-friendly error messages, and the ability to access
protected content using assistive technologies. The system should also
support features like citation generation while maintaining
accessibility standards.</p>
<h2>What This Summary Leaves Out (But You Should Know)</h2>
<p>The full document provides comprehensive implementation guidance for
each user requirement, including detailed technical specifications and
practical examples. Each requirement includes specific considerations
for various assistive technologies, user contexts, and content
formats.</p>
<p>Requirements are categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization
methodology to help developers allocate resources effectively. Must-have
features are essential for basic accessibility, Should-have features
significantly enhance usability, and Could-have features provide
additional benefits.</p>
<p>The document includes user stories that illustrate how real users
might interact with or struggle with features, grounding the
requirements in lived experience. This approach ensures developers
understand both the technical specifications and the human needs behind
each requirement.</p>
