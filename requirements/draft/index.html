<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document presents a detailed set of user requirements to help
developers, designers, and decision-makers understand what individuals
with diverse print disabilities need and expect from digital reading
solutions- especially when it comes to accessibility, usability, and
inclusive design.</p>
<p>Created through close collaboration between DAISY Consortium members,
people with print disabilities, accessibility experts, and developers of
specialized reading apps, this resource captures a wide range of expert
knowledge and practical insights. The document draws on the lived
experiences of people with print disabilities, and the requirements have
been shaped and articulated by professionals with deep expertise in
accessible reading technology.</p>
<p>This <strong>Editors’ Working Draft</strong> represents the results
of six months of working group meetings, workshops, and discussions with
developers. Feedback and collaboration are welcomed as the document
evolves toward the publication, likely in Q4 of 2025.</p>
<p>While the document is particularly relevant for those developing or
procuring specialized reading apps, it also offers valuable guidance for
those working on mainstream reading platforms who wish to make their
products outstandingly accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
Whether you are building a new reading application from the ground up or
enhancing an existing one, we invite you to explore these requirements
not just as a treasure trove of insights into the needs of people with
print disabilities, but as a roadmap toward more inclusive digital
reading experiences.</p>
<section id="userrequirements">
<h2 id="user-requirements">User Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Effective navigation is a critical aspect of digital accessibility.
Users often face challenges in understanding where they are within a
digital publication or application and how to move seamlessly between
sections. For example, screen reader users, who access content
sequentially through synthetic speech or braille displays, rely on
navigation features to rapidly and efficiently orient themselves and
access content efficiently. Readers with learning differences benefit
from clear navigation structures, well-defined headings, and consistent
cues. Understanding and addressing these user requirements is key to
creating inclusive digital experiences that empower all users to
navigate content independently and with ease.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-have-a-straightforward-way-to-navigate-forward-and-backward-through-the-content">The
user must have a straightforward way to navigate forward and backward
through the content</h4>
<p>For content with text it must be possible to move forward and
backward from the currently displayed screen. For content with audio it
must be possible to move forward and backward using time-based
navigation.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-navigate-the-publication-using-the-table-of-contents">The
user must be able to navigate the publication using the Table of
Contents</h4>
<p>When displaying the table of contents, the focus must be on the entry
that matches the user's current reading position. If the publication’s
table of content comprises a hierarchy of entries (e.g. volumes,
chapters, subsections) then it must be presented as a tree view, nested
list view or any other view that conveys the structure to the user. The
user must have a mechanism to move between items in the table of
contents of the same level (e.g. between the chapters without having to
go via the subsections).</p>
<p>Page numbers or percentage information could be provided in the table
of contents.</p>
<p>The user could be able to search within the table of contents.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-have-a-way-to-navigate-the-content-by-pages">The
user must have a way to navigate the content by pages</h4>
<p>When the publication includes page markup, then it must be possible
to navigate by page numbers. If the publication does not include page
markup it could be possible to navigate by ‘pseudo pages’ (where the app
uses an algorithm to approximate navigation points equivalent to typical
page lengths).</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-have-a-way-to-go-to-a-specific-location-in-audio-based-content">The
user must have a way to go to a specific location in audio-based
content</h4>
<p>When reading audio-based content it must be possible to go to a
specific location. This could be based on time, percentage, or another
approach.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-readerassistive-technology-users-must-be-able-to-navigate-through-content-by-headings-block-items-lines-words-and-characters">Screen
reader/assistive technology users must be able to navigate through
content by headings, block items, lines, words and characters</h4>
<p>This functionality is provided by the screen reader or assistive
technology, but it relies on how the audio and text content is exposed
within the app. To support navigation by headings, blocks, lines, words,
and characters, the content must be properly structured and tagged so
that the screen reader can interpret and present it accurately to the
user.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-reader-users-must-be-able-to-read-continuously-from-the-current-position-and-be-able-to-pause-then-resume-reading-from-the-paused-reading-location">Screen
reader users must be able to read continuously from the current
position, and be able to pause, then resume reading from the paused
reading location</h4>
<p>For content with text it must be possible to use the continuous
reading feature of a screen reader to start, pause and resume continuous
reading. The reading should not stop at the end of the display but
continue until the end is reached or stopped by the user.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-return-to-the-last-location-the-next-time-they-open-the-publication">The
user must be able to return to the last location the next time they open
the publication</h4>
<p>The saving of the user's location must happen automatically, for
example when closing the app. When reading text-based content it must be
possible to return to the approximate location (such as the same page or
screen of text). It could be possible to return to the exact last
location.</p>
<p>When reading audio-based content it must be possible to return to the
exact last location.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-determine-their-location-in-the-content">The
user must be able to determine their location in the content</h4>
<p>The user must be able to get information about their current position
in the publication without losing their reading position. The minimum
information expected is the percentage progress.</p>
<p>The user should be able to determine the current chapter, section,
and current page number where this information is provided in the
publication.</p>
<p>Screen reader users must be able to get information about their
current position in the content without losing their reading
position.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-could-be-able-to-go-back-to-a-previous-location-in-the-content">The
user could be able to go back to a previous location in the content</h4>
<p>A “go back” feature within the reading application allows users to
explicitly return to a previous location after navigating through a
digital publication, for example, after following an internal link,
jumping to a search result, or accessing a glossary entry. While some
screen readers offer limited navigation history, an in-app “go back”
function provides a more predictable and user-controlled experience, and
it benefits users who do not use screen readers as well. This is
particularly beneficial for users with print disabilities, as it
supports orientation and reduces cognitive load. The application could
optionally support multiple location histories to enhance usability
across complex publications.</p>
<p>Priority: Could-have</p>
<h3 id="screen-reader-support">Screen Reader Support</h3>
<p>Effective screen reader support depends not only on well-structured
content but also on the reading app’s ability to interact seamlessly
with assistive technologies. The application or platform must enable
screen readers to accurately interpret and present semantic markup,
navigation elements, and interactive features to users. This close
collaboration between the reading app and screen reader ensures that
users can navigate, access, and understand content efficiently.
Addressing these technical requirements is essential to provide a fully
accessible and usable experience for screen reader users.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-use-their-screen-reader-in-the-user-interface">The
user must be able to use their screen reader in the user interface</h4>
<p>The user must be able to navigate and interact with all elements of
the app—including menus, dialogs, buttons, and content—using their
assistive technology. All interactive components shall provide
appropriate semantic labels and roles to support accessibility standards
such as WCAG 2.1 and ARIA guidelines.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-take-advantage-of-their-screen-readers-ability-to-leverage-semantic-markup-in-the-content">The
user must be able to take advantage of their screen reader’s ability to
leverage semantic markup in the content</h4>
<p>The application must allow users to read publication content using a
screen reader. The rendered content must expose the accessibility
semantics to the screen reader. Thus headings, lists, tables, images,
and other semantic elements must be exposed to the screen reader so that
it can be interpreted by the screen reader. Where present, the semantics
of links—such as whether they are bibliographic references or
footnotes—should be made available to screen readers.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-use-their-screen-reader-in-a-scrolling-mode">The
user must be able to use their screen reader in a scrolling mode</h4>
<p>The user must be able to use a scrolling (rather than a paginated
mode) to enable the use of screen reader features (such as navigating to
next/previous heading, landmark, graphic, etc.).</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-reader-users-must-be-able-to-navigate-confidently-between-internal-hyperlinks">Screen
reader users must be able to navigate confidently between internal
hyperlinks</h4>
<p>When navigating to another place in the content (for example when
using the table of contents, reading a footnote or following an internal
hyperlink) the screen reader user must be able to read from the new
navigation position.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-reader-users-must-be-able-to-activate-actionable-content">Screen
reader users must be able to activate actionable content</h4>
<p>Screen reader users must be able to activate actionable content (such
as links, buttons, expandable elements).</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-reader-users-must-be-able-to-return-to-their-previous-reading-position">Screen
reader users must be able to return to their previous reading
position</h4>
<p>After navigating to a different part of the content, such as
following a footnote, internal hyperlink, glossary entry, or switching
to another page, the user must be able to return to their previous
reading position. Most modern screen readers support navigation history
or reading position memory, allowing users to jump back to where they
left off. To enable this functionality effectively, the application must
maintain focus and structural consistency, ensuring that the screen
reader can track and restore the user’s position within the content.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="screen-reader-users-must-be-able-to-use-footnotes-and-endnotes">Screen
reader users must be able to use footnotes and endnotes</h4>
<p>Users must be able to detect the reference to a footnote (or
endnote), reach the content of the footnote, read the content of the
footnote, and provide a mechanism to move back to the original reading
position from the footnote.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-could-use-additional-navigation-features-of-the-reading-app">The
user could use additional navigation features of the reading app</h4>
<p>In addition to the table of contents and other navigation provided by
the content creator, the user could use additional navigation features
offered by the reading app. Such navigation affordances are especially
beneficial to print disabled readers. For example, the app could provide
navigation by heading, between landmarks, tables, figures, and
mathematics expressions, irrespective of whether they are in the same
content document.</p>
<p>Priority: Could-have</p>
<h3 id="read-aloud">Read Aloud</h3>
<p>Note: In this document the term “read aloud” refers to the app
leveraging Text to Speech (TTS) to provide an audio option for
text-based content. This is distinct from embedded audio.</p>
<p>Read aloud functionality plays a crucial role in making digital
content accessible to people with visual impairments, dyslexia, or other
reading challenges. By leveraging Text to Speech (TTS) technology,
reading apps provide a complementary or alternative way to access
text-based information through audio, reducing barriers to reading and
comprehension. To offer a smooth and flexible listening experience, the
reading app must work seamlessly with the TTS engine to support logical
reading order, language changes, and provide the user control over
playback and navigation.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-listen-to-text-based-content-using-synthetic-speech-text-to-speech">The
user must be able to listen to text-based content using synthetic speech
(Text To Speech)</h4>
<p>The user must be able to use a TTS read aloud feature for text-based
content. If the publication also has text synchronized with embedded
audio, then the user must be able to choose the alternative of listening
to the TTS read aloud.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-control-the-starting-position-of-the-read-aloud">The
user must be able to control the starting position of the read
aloud</h4>
<p>The user must be able to choose the position from where the read
aloud begins.</p>
<p>If a screen reader is being used, then the read aloud should start
from the screen reader position.</p>
<p>If a screen reader is not being used, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the user has indicated a start position, then read aloud should
start from there.</li>
<li>if the user has made no selection, then read aloud should start from
an approximate reading position (e.g., the first visible text on the
display).</li>
</ul>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-read-aloud-selected-parts-of-the-content">The
user must be able to read aloud selected parts of the content</h4>
<p>The user must be able to select text (e.g., word, phrase, sentence,
paragraph) and have that read aloud.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-listen-to-the-read-aloud-without-having-to-manually-advance-to-subsequent-pages-or-chapters">The
user must be able to listen to the read aloud without having to manually
advance to subsequent pages or chapters</h4>
<p>The app must be able to continuously read aloud until the end of the
publication, unless interrupted by the user.</p>
<p>The read aloud could support a sleep function, pausing the read aloud
after a user determined period of time.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-have-the-content-read-aloud-in-the-logical-reading-order">The
user must be able to have the content read aloud in the logical reading
order</h4>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-of-read-aloud-must-hear-appropriate-pauses-after-headings-paragraphs-list-items-etc.">The
user of read aloud must hear appropriate pauses after headings,
paragraphs, list items, etc.</h4>
<p>The read aloud must use appropriate pauses after headings, list items
etc., rather than reading as if it is one continuous section of text.
The read aloud implementation should pay attention to commonly used text
content such as numbered headings and lists.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-view-the-text-being-read-aloud">The
user must be able to view the text being read aloud</h4>
<p>The user must be able to see the text that is being read aloud, and
the display must automatically update to keep the spoken text in view.
The techniques for changing the text in display might include scrolling
the text to keep the text being read in the center of the display, or
displaying a new screen of text and starting again at the top. Note that
users may be reading with large text, so additional care should be taken
to consider that the complete text of the first and last sentence may
not be in view.</p>
<p>The user should be able to see the text being read. If starting from
the top of the display then the read aloud should start from the first
visible text in view (that is, the app should not read text that is not
visible). The display should promptly update to always show the text
being read, even if this is partway through a sentence at the bottom of
the display.</p>
<p>The user could have the ability to move to a different part of the
text whilst the read aloud continues. If viewing a different part of the
text, the user should be able to initiate the read aloud from a part of
the text they select.</p>
<p>The user could have the option to use read aloud without the text
displayed.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-visually-emphasize-the-text-being-read-aloud-and-be-able-to-turn-this-feature-off">The
user must be able to visually emphasize the text being read aloud and be
able to turn this feature off</h4>
<p>The user must be able to visually emphasize the text as it is read
aloud using a contrasting highlight, underlining, or other means. Some
users will be hindered by this visual cue, so the user must be able to
turn off the read aloud visual emphasis.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-change-the-color-or-style-of-the-visual-emphasis">The
user must be able to change the color or style of the visual
emphasis</h4>
<p>The user must be able to adjust the visual emphasis. The user could
be able to adjust the number of words that are highlighted at any
time.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-of-read-aloud-must-hear-content-in-the-correct-language">The
user of read aloud must hear content in the correct language</h4>
<p>The user must be able to hear the read aloud using the correct voice
when reading content with language tags (if available to the reading
app). The user should be able to override language switching and select
the language to be used for all content.</p>
<p>The read aloud could switch between dialects of the same language. If
this feature is supported the user must be able to disable it.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-control-the-rate-of-the-read-aloud">The
user must be able to control the rate of the read aloud</h4>
<p>The user must be able to choose the speed of the read aloud voice.
The reading app must not distort the pitch when the user has selected
higher listening speeds.</p>
<p>The reading app could provide an audio preview of the adjusted rate
to assist the user in selection.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-control-the-voice-of-the-read-aloud">The
user must be able to control the voice of the read aloud</h4>
<p>The user must be able to select from a range of voices.</p>
<p>Consideration should made of how the voice options are presented (by
region or language, online/offline, etc). The reading app could provide
an audio preview to assist the user in their selection of voices.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-listen-to-image-alt-text">The user must
be able to listen to image alt text</h4>
<p>The read aloud feature must be able to announce the alt text of
images.</p>
<p>The user must be able to turn off the read aloud of image alt text.
The user should be able to escape from the image alt text once the read
aloud has started.</p>
<p>The image alt text could be distinguished from text content with an
announcement, use of different voice, or other technique.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-listen-to-math-content-when-using-read-aloud">The
user must be able to listen to math content when using read aloud</h4>
<p>The read aloud feature must be able to announce encoded math content
(e.g. MathML).</p>
<p>The user should be able to adjust the announcement of math content
according to their preference (e.g. relative reading speed, reading
style, verbosity).</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-lock-their-mobile-device-and-use-read-aloud">The
user must be able to lock their mobile device and use read aloud</h4>
<p>On a mobile device the user must be able to lock the device without
the read aloud stopping. The user must be able to listen and control
read aloud from the lock screen, to the extent this is supported on the
platform (e.g., pause, resume, go back and forward). The display could
show relevant information such as the current position in the title.</p>
<p>Editor’s note - this probably also applies to audio playback.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-control-read-aloud-playback-using-the-devices-media-controls">The
user must be able to control read-aloud playback using the device’s
media controls</h4>
<p>If supported on the device and platform the user must be able to
control read-aloud playback using the device’s media controls, such
including play, pause, skip forward, skip backward, and stop functions
on a keyboard or headset.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-use-read-aloud-with-tables">The user
must be able to use read aloud with tables</h4>
<p>The read aloud must read the table contents from left to right and
top to bottom. The read aloud could indicate the start of the table
though an announcement or other notification.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-use-read-aloud-with-expandablecollapsable-content">The
user must be able to use read aloud with expandable/collapsable
content</h4>
<p>Expanded content must be read aloud. Collapsed content must not be
read aloud.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-escape-from-certain-structures-when-using-read-aloud">The
user must be able to escape from certain structures when using read
aloud</h4>
<p>The user must be able to control the read aloud so they can avoid
reading all the way through escapable items and to continue read aloud
from the following item (e.g. a table).</p>
<p>Each format specification defines which items can be escaped.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-decide-that-the-read-aloud-should-skip-over-certain-content">The
user must be able to decide that the read aloud should skip over certain
content</h4>
<p>The user must be able to configure their reading app so that it does
not announce skippable elements.</p>
<p>The user preference for skipping non-core content could be set on a
per-title basis.</p>
<p>Each format's specification determines which items can be
skipped.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-could-be-able-to-choose-from-a-range-of-read-aloud-modes">The
user could be able to choose from a range of read aloud modes</h4>
<p>The user could be able to set the mode so that reading aloud is not
continuous. Users should decide how much they want to read (e.g. read
aloud then stop after each word, sentence, paragraph, page, or
chapter).</p>
<p>Priority: Could-have</p>

<h4
id="the-user-could-be-able-to-choose-to-have-semantic-expressiveness-for-read-aloud">The
user could be able to choose to have semantic expressiveness for read
aloud</h4>
<p>The user could be able to adjust the pitch or style for emphasized
text (eg bold, italic, underlined). If this feature is available, users
should have the option to turn it off.</p>
<p>Priority: Could-have</p>
<h3 id="embedded-audio">Embedded Audio</h3>
<p>Note: In this document the term “embedded audio” refers to the audio
content (could be human narrated audio or generated Text to Speech) that
is provided as part of the publication. This is distinct from read
aloud, where the app dynamically uses on device or cloud TTS to create
an audio rendition whilst reading the publication.</p>
<p>Embedded audio includes both audio-only publications and synchronized
audio-text formats, where the audio is aligned with the visual text.
Audio-only formats are a long-standing favorite among people with print
disabilities, offering a streamlined, immersive listening experience.
They are also increasingly popular in mainstream contexts, such as for
multitasking or screen-free reading.</p>
<p>Synchronized audio-text formats offer additional benefits by enabling
users to follow the structure of the text while listening. This supports
a wide range of reading strategies—for example, allowing users to
navigate the text with assistive technologies, adjust playback speed or
verbosity, or combine listening with reading for improved comprehension
and control. Although this functionality is not yet widely supported in
reading systems, it holds great potential for inclusive and flexible
reading experiences.</p>
<p>This section outlines the core user requirements for interacting with
embedded audio, including playback control, synchronization with text,
visual emphasis, and customization. These features ensure that users can
access high-quality narration in a way that aligns with the structure

<p>To ensure a coherent listening experience, the reading system must
play embedded audio in the correct reading order. For audio-only
publications, this typically follows the sequence of audio files as

embedded audio, if synchronized text is available</h4>
<p>When embedded audio is synchronized with text, the user must be able
to see the relevant text, and the display must automatically update to
keep the spoken text in view. The techniques for changing the text in
display might include scrolling the text to keep the text being read in
the center of the display or displaying a new screen of text and
starting again at the top. Keep in mind that some users may use large
text settings, so it's important to consider that they might not see the
entire first or last sentence.</p>
<p>The user should be able to see the text being read. If starting from
the top of the display then the audio playback should start from the
first visible text in view (that is, should not read text that is not
visible). The display should promptly update to always show the text
being read, even if this is partway through a sentence at the bottom of
the display.</p>
<p>The user could have the ability to move to a different part of the
text whilst the playback continues. If viewing a different part of the
text, the user should be able to initiate the playback from a part of

<h3 id="visual-adjustments">Visual Adjustments</h3>
<p>Flexible display options in a reading app are essential for people
with print disabilities, especially those with low vision or dyslexia.
Allowing users to customize the visual presentation of text and images —
including font type, size, color contrast, spacing, and margins —
significantly improves readability and comfort. These adaptations reduce
visual stress and cognitive load, making it easier for users to process
and understand content. By removing visual barriers, reading apps become
more accessible, empowering users to have a more personalized and
effective reading experience.</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-change-the-typeface">The user must be
able to change the typeface</h4>
<p>The user must be able to change the typeface of all text, choosing
from a range including sans serif and serif fonts. Individuals with low
vision or dyslexia often have specific preferences for font styles that
optimize their reading experience. Typefaces with preferred letter
shapes can aid in visual processing, improve comprehension, and reduce
cognitive load.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-change-the-font-weight">The user must
be able to change the font weight</h4>
<p>For some people, bold text is easier to read. Many typefaces have a
bold font and some offer variable weight. The user must be able to
select a typeface with a bold weight. The user could be able to adjust
the weight of selected typefaces.</p>
<p>Visual readability of text requires good visual contrast. Visual
contrast is a product of the text characteristics, such as font weight
(thickness, font stroke width) and font size, the lightness/darkness
difference of the colors used for the text and the background, and other
factors.</p>

user must be able to turn off justification and center-alignment of
blocks of text</h4>
<p>Justification impacts readability and tracking. Fully justified text
creates uneven spaces between words and letters, leading to “rivers of
white space” that disrupt reading flow and visual tracking, particularly
for people with dyslexia. Users with low vision who rely on screen
magnifiers may encounter exaggerated gaps or overlapping characters in
justified text, making it harder to read. Center-aligned text is also
problematic for multi-line blocks, as it disrupts smooth reading flow
and makes it harder to find the beginning of lines. Depending on the
reading order of the language concerned (left to right, or right to
left) turning the justification or center-alignment off results in a
left-aligned or right-aligned text.</p>

adjusting the text’s font size and color</h4>
<p>Math expressions written in MathML or LaTeX (when that format is
supported) need to be shown properly. As the user adjusts the size and
colors of the text content, the math expressions should change

<p>Some people need high contrast between text and background, including
many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from ageing. Some
individuals prefer reading dark text on a light background. Others find
it easier to read with low contrast and colors that present less
glare.</p>
<p>For some people, common color combinations or colors from a limited
color palette work fine, for example, black text on white background or
the inverse with white text on black background. For instance, black
text on a white background is specifically useful for people with
dyslexia. Other people need to select more specific background and text
colors. For example, people who need low brightness overall, need to
select the specific background and text colors that provide sufficient
contrast for them yet not too high brightness. Readable and optimal
color combinations differs vastly among individuals and can even vary

<h3 id="entering-answers">Entering Answers</h3>
<p><strong>Special note:</strong> reading systems typically let users
add notes but currently do not support answer entry. However, this is an
important need for learners with print disabilities. This section
summarises user needs for this functionality, based on workshops at
Dedicon and discussions with app developers and the user requirements
working group. This section aims to help designers and developers assess
how this functionality could be implemented.</p>
<p>Learners with print disabilities can face significant challenges when
completing exercises in books: if they are unable to read or write in
physical books, they are often required to write their answers into a
word processor, which can be time-consuming and mentally draining. The
ability to input answers precisely where questions or prompts appear in
the digital content makes the experience more intuitive and less
fragmented.</p>
<p>Questions can take many forms, and so the ability to enter various
input types—from simple text fields to multiple-choice
selections—ensures that all users can respond effectively and
independently. Accessibility features such as screen reader
compatibility and the ability to save and edit responses are essential
for an inclusive and seamless user experience. Additionally,
synchronization and export options provide greater flexibility, enabling
users to access and manage their responses across devices and
contexts.</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-enter-edit-and-review-answers-into-input-fields-embedded-within-a-publication">The
user must be able to enter, edit and review answers into input fields
embedded within a publication</h4>
<p>The input fields must support a range of common types, including
single-line text fields, multi-line text areas, radio buttons,
checkboxes, and dropdown menus. This enables interaction with different
kinds of questions or prompts directly at the point where they appear in
the content, avoiding the need to switch to separate documents or
tools.</p>
<p>Text input must be the primary format supported and could also
accommodate structured formats such as linear math (e.g., LaTeX or
Unicode math). Although audio input could be supported, it is not
anticipated to become the main method of interaction.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-save-their-answers">The user must be
able to save their answers</h4>
<p>Saving should occur automatically to reduce the risk of data loss and
to support a seamless user experience. Ideally, answers are saved online
to allow synchronization across multiple devices. In such cases, the
system must also support offline use, with answers being stored locally
and synchronized once the device reconnects to the internet. If online
saving is not feasible, answers must still be saved locally in a
reliable and persistent manner.</p>
<p>Priority: Must-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-must-be-able-to-see-previously-saved-answers-when-reopening-a-book">The
user must be able to see previously saved answers when reopening a
book</h4>
<p>When a user returns to a publication, previously saved answers must
be restored to the input fields and clearly associated with their
corresponding questions or prompts. This ensures continuity in learning
and avoids the frustration of lost work. Restored answers must be
editable, so that users can continue working from where they left off.
This applies regardless of whether the answers were saved locally or
synchronized via an online service.</p>

<p>Some users, particularly in educational or professional contexts, may
need to emphasize parts of their answers using basic formatting options
such as bold, italic, or underline. This can help structure responses,
highlight key points, or mirror expected formatting conventions in
assignments. While implementing rich text editing in accessible reading
systems may present technical challenges, it is a feature users are
likely to expect in the future. Exploring this functionality now can
help prepare for more advanced input needs as digital reading systems

<p>A straightforward way to share answers is by exporting them in a
separate file format such as .html, .csv, or another accessible format.
This exported file should include clear references to the related
questions or assignments, enabling recipients to understand the context.
Users can then send this file to teachers, classmates, or others outside
the reading system.</p>

<p>In some cases, content providers may unintentionally omit input
fields for certain questions or assignments within accessible
publications. Allowing users to add their own input fields ensures they
can still provide responses in these cases. These custom fields must
support the same range of input types as predefined fields, be fully
accessible through screen readers and keyboard navigation, and be
included when exporting answers.</p>
<p>Priority: Could-have</p>
<h4
id="the-user-could-be-able-to-synchronize-answers-across-multiple-devices">The

emerging needs and to support future exploration and innovation in
accessible digital reading.</p>
<h4 id="dynamic-content-based-on-user-input-issue-tracker-2">Dynamic
content based on user input (issue tracker #2)</h4>
<p>The user could enter personal or contextual information (e.g., number
of servings, name, or variables) that dynamically updates the content of
the publication.</p>
<p>Allowing users to input values—such as the number of people to cook
for or a name for personalized narration—enables dynamic updates to the
content. This can make digital publications more engaging and practical.
For users with print disabilities, such features can reduce cognitive

<p>If supported by platform accessibility APIs, text style properties
such as font, line spacing, indentation, justification, and emphasis
(e.g., bold, italic, underline) must be exposed to assistive
technologies.<br />
Priority: Should-have</p>
<p>Disclosing text style properties allows assistive technologies—such
as screen readers and braille displays—to convey visual structure and
emphasis in non-visual ways. For example, indentation and justification
can help represent layout on a braille device, while bold or italic text
may be rendered using specific braille indicators. This enhances
comprehension and preserves the author’s intended structure and meaning
for users with print disabilities.</p>
<h4 id="turn-hyphenation-onoff-issue-tracker-6-and-24">Turn hyphenation
on/off (issue tracker #6 and 24)</h4>
<p>Hyphenation can affect readability and comprehension, especially for
users with print disabilities such as dyslexia or low vision. Allowing
users to turn hyphenation on or off gives them control over how text is
presented, helping to reduce visual clutter and improve the flow of
reading. This customization supports a more accessible and comfortable
reading experience.</p>
<h4
id="synchronized-text-audio-and-switching-between-reading-modes-issue-tracker-7">Synchronized
Text-Audio and Switching between reading modes (issue tracker #7)</h4>
<p>The functionality of synchronized text and audio—where professionally
narrated or pre-recorded audio is aligned with the visual text—is
already well represented in the Embedded Audio section of this document.
That section outlines key user requirements such as synchronized
playback, visual emphasis, navigation, and customization of the reading
experience.</p>
<p>However, one important aspect is not yet fully addressed: the ability
for users to switch flexibly between listening and reading modes. This
includes scenarios where a user may: Pause embedded audio to read the
text independently, either visually or with a screen reader; Resume
audio playback from the same point after reading; Transition seamlessly
between human narration, TTS read aloud, and screen reader use.</p>
<p>This kind of multimodal interaction supports diverse reading
strategies and is especially valuable for users with print disabilities
who benefit from combining auditory and visual input. Future development
should explore how reading systems can support synchronized state
management across different modes, ensuring continuity and user control
regardless of how the content is accessed.</p>

their importance for navigation, study, and personalization. Future work
should explore how bookmarking can best support users with print
disabilities, including possible integration with notes, accessibility
via assistive technologies, and synchronization across devices.</p>
<h4 id="follow-external-links-issue-tracker-12">Follow external links
(issue tracker #12)</h4>
<p>Some digital publications include hyperlinks to external web
resources. Users should be able to follow these links and open them in
