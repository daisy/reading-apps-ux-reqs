## Introduction

This document is the main output of the [DAISY project to develop user requirements for reading apps](https://daisy.org/activities/projects/reading-apps-user-requirements/). The project draws on the collective expertise and experiences of [DAISY Consortium members and friends](https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/) to express user requirements of individuals with diverse print disabilities for reading digital publications.

This unique document is intended to inform developers and purchasers of specialized reading systems and provide inspiration for mainstream reading solutions.
