## Introduction

This document is the main output of the [DAISY project to develop user requirements for reading apps](https://daisy.org/activities/projects/reading-apps-user-requirements/). The project draws on the collective expertise and experiences of [DAISY Consortium members and friends](https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/) to express user requirements of individuals with diverse print disabilities for reading digital publications.

This unique document is intended to inform developers and purchasers of specialized reading systems and provide inspiration for mainstream reading solutions.

## User Requirements

### Visual Adjustments - Text

User story: [Oxana](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/#oxana), 
[Ruth](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/#ruth),

#### The user must be able to change the typeface.

The user should be able to change the typeface of all text, choosing from a range including sans serif and serif fonts. Individuals with low vision or dyslexia often have specific preferences for font styles that optimize their reading experience. Typefaces with preferred letter shapes can aid in visual processing, improve comprehension and reduce cognitive load.

Priority: Must-have

Sources: [visual-010 : Change font](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-510), 
[Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: font face](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#font)

#### The user must be able to change the font weight.

Visual readability of text requires good visual contrast. Visual contrast is a product of the text characteristics, such as font weight (thickness, font stroke width) and font size, the lightness/darkness difference of the colors used for the text and the background, and other factors. For some people, bold text is easier to read which is why they should be have bold font options. Many typefaces have a bold font and some offer variable weight. 

Priority: Must-have

Sources: [WCAG Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 - Draft version: visual contrast of text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/font-characteristics-contrast/), [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: text style](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#style)

#### The user must be able to change the text size.

Some people need to increase the size of text in order to read it. Although increasing size is most common, some people with tunnel vision and good visual acuity may prefer to decrease the size so they can see more text at a time.

Priority: Must-have

Sources: [visual-010 : Change font size](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-010),

[The effect of print size on reading speed in dyslexia. Journal of Research in Reading](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9817.2005.00273.x)

#### The user should be able to remove the visual text styling (underline, italic, bold).

For some people, it is difficult to read text that is italicized, underlined or bold. Users should have the option to view the text without these visual formatting styles. However, underlining should be retained for hyperlinks. While removing formatting may result in the loss of some semantic significance, users should be able to toggle back to the visually formatted version as needed.

Priority: Should-have

Sources: [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: text style](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#style)

#### The user could be able change the capitalization of text to sentence style.

Text written in all capital letters or all small capital letters is more difficult to read for most people, with and without disabilities. Users should have the option to choose a sentence-style version. Acronyms that are correctly marked as abbreviations will remain in uppercase; otherwise, they will be converted to sentence style. Users should also be able to toggle between the different styles as needed.

Priority: Could-have

Sources: [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: capitalization](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#capitalization)

#### The user must be able change the line spacing, word spacing and letter spacing.

The amount of line spacing (leading), word spacing (space between words) and letter spacing (space between letters/characters) impacts readability. Some people need more space to read text and will have individual preferences. Line spacing also helps with tracking.

User story: [Ruth](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/#ruth),
[Javier](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/#javier)

Priority: Must-have

[Extra-large letter spacing improves reading in dyslexia](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1205566109).

#### The user must be able turn off justification and center-alignment of blocks of text.

Justification impacts readability and tracking. Fully justified text creates uneven spaces between words and letters, leading to "rivers of white space" that disrupt reading flow and visual tracking, particularly for people with dyslexia. Users with low vision who rely on screen magnifiers may encounter exaggerated gaps or overlapping characters in justified text, making it harder to read. Center-aligned text is also problematic for multi-line blocks, as it disrupts smooth reading flow and makes it harder to find the beginning of lines. Depending on the reading order of the language concerned (left to right, or right to left) turning the justification or center-alignment off results in a left-aligned or right-aligned text. 

Priority: Must-have

Sources: [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: justification/alignment](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#justification)

#### The user must be able to change the margins and adjust the line length for blocks of text.

Having wide margins results in shorter line lengths. This can be helpful for some people with specific learning disabilities. Having wide margins around blocks of text helps some people focus on the text and not get distracted by other content. 

Conversely, wide margins can make line length too short for people who use large text.

#### The user must be able to view the content in a scrolling view.

For reflowable content, if the reader offers a paginated view, then the user should also be able to vie it in a scrollabe view.

### Visual Adjustments - Images

#### The user must be able to enlarge images.

The user should be able to select an image and make it larger. There should be controls to adjust the size and to pan around an image when it no longer fits within the display.

A custom color theme used for viewing the text can sometimes render parts of the image difficult to see. There could be the option in the image viewer to revert to the default color mode, or to choose different color themes.

User story:

Priority: [Must-have]

Source: [visual-710 : Enlarge SVG Images](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-710)

### Visual Adjustments - Math

#### The user must be able to adjust the size and color of math expressions by adjusting the text's font size and color.

Math expressions included as MathML (or LaTeX, if supported) should be displayed correctly. As the user adjusts the size and colors of the text content, the math expressions should change accordingly. As the text size is increased, so should the math expressions in proportion. As the user changes the colors for the text content, this should also affect the math expressions.

User story:

Priority: Must-have

Source: [visual-550 : Viewing MathML](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-550)

#### The user should be able to enlarge math expressions for closer inspection.

Math expressions often contain small symbols such as exponents, indices, dot notations and derivatives. It should be possible for the user to view a math expression as a separate item and enlarge it.

Priority: Should-have

Source:

#### The user could be able [to flatten the colors of math expressions].

Certain parts of math expressions are sometimes presented in special colors, e.g. superscript in red. For some people this can present problems. The user could be able to remove the color formatting used in math expressions so the chosen text color is always used.

### Visual Adjustments - Color and Brightness

#### The user must be able to personalize the background and foreground colors.

The user should be able to set the background and text color from the full color spectrum.

Some people need high contrast between text and background, including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from ageing. Some read better with dark text on light background. Others find it easier to read with low contrast and colors that present less glare.

For some people, common color combinations or colors from a limited color palette work fine, for example, black text on white background or the inverse with white text on black background. For instance, black text on a white background is specifically useful for people with dyslexia. Other people need to select more specific background and text colors. For example, people who need low brightness overall, need to select the specific background and text colors that provide sufficient contrast for them yet not too high brightness. Readable and optimal color combinations differs vastly among individuals and can even vary for one individual depending on conditions such as fatigue and lighting.

User story:

Priority: [Must-have for a limited color palette; Should-have for more specific background and text colors]

Sources: [visual-110 : Change background and foreground color](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-110), [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision: text contrast](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#text-contrast)

#### The user must be able to use the app with the high contrast and magnification features of the operating system platform.

Some people use high contrast modes on their device because it increases readability by maximizing the difference between text and background. Some people use the magnification feature of the operating system, or third party tools, to increase the size of text and images on the display.

Users must be able to use these features with the reading app. The app should respect the high contrast settings chosen by the user.

User story: [Stefan](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/use-cases/#stefan)

Priority: Must-have

Source: [visual-310 : Apply high contrast system configuration](https://www.epubtest.org/test-books/visual-adjustments/2.0.0/visual-310)

#### The user must be able to change the display brightness.

Some individuals with low vision or dyslexia may have photophobia or light sensitivity. The ability to dim the screen can make reading more comfortable for these users. For some people with age-related macular degeneration, brighter illumination has been shown to improve reading acuity, critical print size, and maximum reading speed. Adjusting brightness can enhance the contrast between text and background, making it easier for individuals with low vision to distinguish letters and words.

The user must be able to adjust the display brightness when using the reading app. If this is not possible on the device or the operating system, it must be possible in the reading app itself.

If it is possible to adjust the display brightness on the device or in the operating system, it could be possible in the reading app itself.

#### The user must have a way to navigate the publication using the Table of Contents.

The focus must be on the entry for the current reading position when the user is presented with the table of contents. If the publication's table of content comprises a hierachy of entries (eg volumes, chapters, subsections) then it must be presented as a tree view, nested list view or any other view that conveys the structure to the user. The user must have a mechanism to move between items in the table of contents of the same level (eg between the chapters without having to go via the subsections).

Page numbers or percentage information could be provided in the table of contents. The user could be able to search within the table of contents.

#### The user must have a way to navigate the content by pages.

When the publication includes page markup then it must be possible to navigate by page numbers. If the publication does not include page markup it could be possible to navigate by 'pseudo pages' (where the app uses an algorithm to approximate navigation points equivalent to typical page lengths).

### Read Aloud

In this requirements document the term "read aloud" refers to the app using Text To Speech (TTS) to provide an audio option for text-based content.

#### The user must be able to listen to text-based content using synthetic speech (Text To Speech).

The user must be able to use a TTS read aloud feature for text-based content. If the publication also has synchronised audio with the text then the user must be able to choose the alternative of listening to the TTS read aloud.
