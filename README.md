# reading-apps-ux-reqs
Welcome to our repository for the [DAISY project to develop user requirements for reading apps](https://daisy.org/activities/projects/reading-apps-user-requirements/).

This project will  enhance the experience of print disabled people using apps to read accessible content, leveraging the collective expertise and experiences of [DAISY Consortium members and friends](https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/).

The primary audience is DAISY members and other providers of specialist reading services involved in evaluating, procuring, or developing solutions for reading services. The project output will be a document that expresses user requirements of individuals with diverse print disabilities for reading digital publications. The document will be highly valuable for the developers of specialized reading systems and provide inspiration for mainstream reading solutions.

Participants are invited to [join the project mailing list](https://daisylists.org/postorius/lists/reading-apps-ux-reqs.daisylists.org/) which will be used to share information, ask questions, and announce the working group meetings. 

The next working group meetings is scheduled for 29 September to the discuss the latest version of the [user requirements editors' working draft](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/requirements/draft/) before issuing a Release Candidate version of the specification.
