# reading-apps-ux-reqs
Welcome to our repository for the [DAISY project to develop user requirements for reading apps](https://daisy.org/activities/projects/reading-apps-user-requirements/).

This project was intended to enhance the experience of print disabled people using apps to read accessible content, leveraging the collective expertise and experiences of [DAISY Consortium members and friends](https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/). Participants were invited to [join the project mailing list](https://daisylists.org/postorius/lists/reading-apps-ux-reqs.daisylists.org/) which was used to share information, ask questions, and announce the working group meetings.
The [working group meetings](https://github.com/daisy/reading-apps-ux-reqs/wiki/Meeting-notes) ran between December 2024 through September 2025.

The project output is a document that expresses user requirements of individuals with diverse print disabilities for reading digital publications. It is hoped that the document will be highly valuable for the developers of specialized reading systems and provide inspiration for mainstream reading solutions.

The Editors invite comments on the [Release Candidate version of the specification](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/requirements/published/CR-20251011/) and the [Executive Summary]([url](https://daisy.github.io/reading-apps-ux-reqs/requirements/published/ES-20251011) before 31 October 2025.
